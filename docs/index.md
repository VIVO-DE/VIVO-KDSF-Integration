## KDSF-VIVO-Alignment V. 1.3

KDSF ontology alignment (Kerndatensatz Forschung = Research Core Dataset) for use in VIVO. 
The KDSF (short for Kerndatensatz Forschung) is a standard for research information for the German science system. It represents a set of rules for the harmonisation and standardisation of research reporting at universities and scientific institutions.

The repository attempts to integrate the [Core Data Set Research](http://kerndatensatz-forschung.de/) (KDSF) V.1.3 into [vivo-project/VIVO](https://github.com/vivo-project/VIVO). 

The basic model with the basic research-related objects such as person, publication, externally funded projects, structured doctoral programme, patent and research infrastructure is mapped to the VIVO-ontology in order for projects to be able to relate VIVO objects with KDSF objects, making it possible to represent research information for reports within the KDSF framework
